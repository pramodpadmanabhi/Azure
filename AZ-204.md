### Choose the best Azure service to automate your business process
### Create serverless logic with Azure functions

 * #### Serverless Compute ?
      * Serverless compute can be thought of as a function as a service(faas) or a microservice hosted on a cloud platform
      * Cloud Provider manages infrastructure
      * App is automatically scaled our or down depending on load
      * Eg - Azure Functions 
  * #### Characteristics of Serverless soultion
      * Avoid over-allocation of infrastructure
      * Stateless Logic (Function Instances are created and destroyed)
      * Event Driven
      * Can be used in traditional compute environments
   * #### Drawbacks of a serverless compute solution
      * Execution Time
      * Execution Frequency
   * #### Azure Functions Choices
      * Consumption Plan - Serverless, Automatic scale, 5min limit
      * App Service Plan - Traditional Pricing Model,
      * Premium Plan - Speed, Security, Reserved Instances, Automatic Scaling
      * Docker Container - On Premises in any cloud
      * Locally - Development and testing
   * #### Binding
      * Binding is a declarative way to connect data and services to a function
      * Eg - trigger , responds to an event/ activity and executes code
 
### Execute Azure Functions with triggers
   * #### Trigger
     * Trigger is an object that defines how an azure function is invoked
     * Eg - Timer,Http, Blob etc
   * #### Timer Trigger
     * Trigger that executes a function at a consistent interval
          * Timestamp paramater name , identifier to access the trigger in code
          * Schedule , CRON expression that sets the interval for the timer
   * #### CRON expression
     * CRON expression is a string of six fields that represent a set of times
     * {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}
     * astreik - selects every value in a field
     * ' - seperates items in a list
     * hypen - Specifies a range
     * / - Specifies an increment
   * #### Http Trigger
     * Trigger which executes a function when it receives a Http Request
     * Authorization Level - Indicates whether incoming request reuires API Keys for authentication
     * Three levels of Authorization 
       * Function - Function key(Specific to a function)/Host Key
       * Admin - Host Key(Applies to all the host in Function App)
       * Anonymous - No Authentication
   * #### Blob Trigger
     * Trigger that executes a function when a file is uploaded or updated in Azure Blob Storage
     * Path tells the blob trigger where to monitor to see if a blob is updated ot uploaded eg - sampleWorkitems/{name}
### Chain Azure functions together using input and output bindings
### create long-running serverless workflow with durable functions
### Develop test and publish Azure Functions using Azure Functions Core Tools
### Develop test and deploy an Azure Function with VisualStudio
### Monitor Github Events by using a webhook with Azure Functions
### Enable automatic updates in a web application using Azure Functions and SignalR Service
### Expose multiple Azure Function apps as a consitent API by using Azure API Managment
### Build serverless apps with Go

## Function App Scaling
